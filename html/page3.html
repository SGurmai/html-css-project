        <h2 class="h2_main">14th Century</h2>
    <p>The 14th century marked a period of significant evolution in medieval armor, driven by advancements in technology, 
        changes in warfare tactics, and the desire for enhanced protection on the battlefield. Here's an overview of armor during the 14th century:</p>
        <h2>Materials and Construction:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mail (Maille): Mail continued to be a staple in armor construction during the 14th century. The four-in-one pattern remained common, providing flexibility 
                    and protection against slashing attacks.</li>
                <li>Gambeson: Gambesons or aketons, padded garments, continued to be worn beneath the mail for added protection and comfort.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Helmets:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bascinet: The bascinet gained popularity during this period. It was a close-fitting helmet with a rounded skull and a hinged visor that could be raised or lowered. 
                    The bascinet offered better protection to the face compared to earlier helmet designs.</li>
                <li>Sallet: Towards the end of the century, the sallet emerged as a distinctive helmet. It featured a pointed tail at the back for added neck protection and a visor that could be 
                    pivoted or hinged.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Body Armor:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hauberk: The hauberk, a knee-length mail shirt, continued to be worn, but the length often varied. Some versions extended to the mid-thighs, while others were shorter.</li>   
                <li>Cuirass: By the mid-14th century, knights began to use the cuirass, a torso armor consisting of a breastplate and a backplate. This marked a transition toward more extensive 
                    use of plate armor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Limbs Protection:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Plate Armor Components: Plate armor started to become more prevalent during the 14th century. Knights incorporated small plates, known as "plackart" or "placken," to protect the 
                    lower abdomen. Additionally, segmented plates (vambraces and greaves) protected the arms and legs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Shields:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Heater Shield: The heater shield became popular during the 14th century. It was characterized by a distinctive shape resembling an inverted triangle or "heater."</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Full Plate Armor (Late 14th Century):</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In the later part of the 14th century, full plate armor began to emerge. This revolutionary form of armor covered the entire body in articulated steel plates, providing superior 
                    protection while allowing for increased mobility.</li>
                <li>The transition to full plate armor was gradual, with early examples featuring a combination of chainmail, plate components, and additional protection for vulnerable areas.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Visors and Face Protection:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Grille Visor: Some helmets featured a grille visor a faceplate with a mesh or grill-like design to protect the face while allowing for better visibility and airflow.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>The 14th century witnessed a dynamic shift from predominantly mail armor to the increasing use of plate components, laying the groundwork for the fully developed plate armor that would 
        become synonymous with the late medieval period. This period also saw ongoing experimentation with various forms of protection, reflecting the continuous adaptation to the changing demands of warfare.</p>
