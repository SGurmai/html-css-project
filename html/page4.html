        <h2 class="h2_main">15th Century</h2>
    <p>The 15th century witnessed significant developments in medieval armor, marked by the transition from 
        mail armor to the widespread use of plate armor. Here's an overview of armor during the 15th century:</p>
        <h2>Materials and Construction:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Plate Armor: The 15th century saw the increasing prevalence of plate armor. Knights and men-at-arms 
                    began to wear full suits of armor made up of articulated plates, providing comprehensive protection.</li>
                <li>Steel: Plate armor was typically constructed from steel, providing superior protection compared to earlier 
                    materials.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Helmets:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Visored Helmets: Helmets of the 15th century often featured visors that could be raised or lowered. 
                    This allowed knights to have better visibility and breathing when the visor was up and increased protection 
                    when it was down during battle.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Body Armor:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cuirass: The cuirass, consisting of a breastplate and a backplate, became a standard component of plate armor 
                    during this period. These pieces were often crafted to fit the contours of the body, providing enhanced protection.</li>  
        </ul>
        <h2>Limbs Protection:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Articulated Limb Armor: Arm and leg protection became more articulated, with separate components for the upper and 
                    lower arms (vambraces) and upper and lower legs (greaves). These components allowed for better mobility.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Joints and Articulation:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Articulated Joints: Plate armor of the 15th century was designed with articulated joints, allowing the wearer to move more freely. 
                    These joints were often connected by rivets, enabling flexibility without compromising protection.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Shields:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Targe and Buckler: While plate armor provided extensive protection, some warriors still used smaller shields such as 
                    the targe or buckler in conjunction with their armor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Decoration:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Etching and Engraving: Plate armor of the 15th century was sometimes decorated with etchings or engravings for both 
                    aesthetic and functional purposes. Decorative patterns and designs were etched into the surface, and some armor 
                    featured gilded elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Transition Period:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Coexistence with Mail Armor: While plate armor became more widespread, mail armor continued to be used, especially 
                    in conjunction with plate components. This transitional period saw a combination of both types of armor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Heraldic Symbols:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Coat of Arms: Knights often displayed their heraldic symbols on their armor, helping to identify them on the 
                    battlefield. These symbols were painted or affixed to the armor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Late 15th Century Innovations:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Maximilian-style Armor: Toward the end of the 15th century, Maximilian-style armor emerged, named after 
                    Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. This style featured fluting and ridges on the armor for both aesthetic and 
                    functional purposes.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>The 15th century represents a crucial period in the evolution of medieval armor, with the widespread adoption of 
        plate armor signaling a shift toward more comprehensive and articulated protection. The development of sophisticated armor 
        during this time reflected advancements in metallurgy, manufacturing techniques, and the changing nature of warfare.</p>
