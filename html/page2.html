            <p>In the 13th century, armor underwent significant developments and changes, 
        reflecting the evolving nature of warfare and advancements in metallurgy and blacksmithing 
        techniques. Here's an overview of armor during the 13th century:</p>
        <h2>Materials and Construction:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>(Maille): Mail continued to be a prevalent form of armor. It consisted of interlinked metal rings, 
                    typically made of iron. The rings were often arranged in a four-in-one pattern, providing flexibility and protection against slashing attacks.
                </li>
                <li>Gambeson: Beneath the mail, soldiers often wore a padded garment known as a 
                    gambeson. The gambeson provided additional protection and served as a cushion against 
                    the impact of blows.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Helmets:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Great Helm: The 13th century saw the rise of the great helm, a cylindrical or conical-shaped helmet 
                    that fully enclosed the head. It often featured a flat top and a T-shaped or cross-shaped opening for 
                    vision and breathing. The great helm provided better protection to the face compared to earlier helmet 
                    designs.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Body Armor:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hauberk: The hauberk, a knee-length mail shirt, remained a common piece of armor for the torso. 
                    It covered the body from the neck to the thighs and sometimes included sleeves.</li>
                <li>Surcoat: Over the armor, knights and men-at-arms would wear a surcoat, a loose garment with a distinctive 
                    coat-of-arms or heraldic design. The surcoat helped identify individuals on the battlefield and shielded 
                    the armor from the sun.</li>
                <li>Brigandine: Towards the end of the century, some warriors began using brigandine a type of armor made of 
                    small steel plates riveted to a fabric or leather base. Brigandine provided good protection while being more flexible than full plate armor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Limbs Protection:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mail Chausses: mail leggings called chausses were worn to protect the legs. These extended from the hips 
                    down to the ankles and were attached to a belt or the bottom of the hauberk.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Shields:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Kite Shield: Shields continued to be an essential part of a warrior's defense. In the 13th century, the kite 
                    shield became popular. It had a distinctive shape, tapering down to a point, and offered good protection for mounted and foot soldiers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Transition to Plate Armor:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The late 13th century witnessed the emergence of early forms of plate armor. Knights started to incorporate small steel plates or "plates" attached 
                    to vulnerable areas, such as the knees and elbows, as a precursor to the more fully developed plate armor of the following centuries.</li>
